# Contributing to IDA-minsc

Contribution to the IDA-minsc plugin is pretty much exclusively done with
GitHub's interface. Hence, there are numerous places in which one can to
contribute to the IDA-minsc plugin. Some of these places can be the
documentation, the plugin itself, writing tutorials, blogposts, adding to
the project wiki, helping with user issues, or even idling on the irc
channel.

## Issues

If you're unsure of how to do something or the documentation isn't clear,
feel free to create an issue and someone will try and help you figure it
out, or the documentation can be updated with your concern.

If you find yourself constantly typing something and discovering it not
being there, or if you desire a shorter alias for some common namespace
that you use, feel free to create an issue requesting an alias be made.
This can then be discussed and possibly merged if it doesn't conflict
with something in the future and it's (of course) reasonable.

### Reporting an issue

Before reporting an issue, search the current issue tracker to see if
someone else has already reported your issue. If it is related to
another issue, feel free to reference that in your new issue's details.
Any duplicate issues will be re-referenced and closed so that related
discussion can occur in the original issue that was reported.

When creating your issue be sure to include the version of IDA you're using,
the platform it's running on (32-bit or 64-bit), the architecture of your
database, and whatever code you're running that doesn't appear to work.

## Pull requests

When submitting a pull request, please rebase it against `master` before
submitting. If you are creating a fix for a particular issue, please name
the branch according to the issue number as `GH-#`. This causes GitHub
to automatically create a reference which allows for simple correlation
of PRs to the issues that they are for.

When submitting a pull request, keep in mind about what version of IDA
your PR doesn't work on. This plugin aims to be backwards compatible
with IDA all the way back to 6.9. This is right before the `idaapi`
module was split up into its current state. If your addition does not
support one of these versions, please make sure you mention it in
the details of the PR you're trying to get merged upstream so a
committer can come up with a solution or workaround if possible.

Another thing to pay attention to is which module (or context) your
addition is for. If your addition warrants the creation of a new base
module, please create a separate PR with details about why you feel
that a new module is necessary along with a reference to the PR that
includes your addition. This way the creation of new modules can be
discussed or possibly staged inside a different path before your new
functionality gets added to them.

The last thing to note is keep in mind how multicase functions work.
If you're not sure of what these are, please refer to the documentation.
When you are adding a new function, try and consider what other types
your function might be able to take, and the different ways the plugin
can automatically determine those types using IDA.

### Pull requests in progress

If you're still working on a pull request, you can prefix the title of
your pull request with "[WIP]". This will notify any user with commit
access that your PR is still in development. When you're ready for it
to be merged, remove the prefix or mention it in the discussion so
that way it can be reviewed before it gets merged.

### Titling pull requests

When titling the pull request, prefix it with the path that the user
needs to type at the IDAPython prompt in order to navigate to the
module that contains your addition. If the addition is within a file
in the root directory, include the full filename.

As an example, the `base/database.py` module might have a title of:

    database: added blah blah function
    
Another example, say for `idapythonrc.py` could be:

    idapythonrc.py: added support for external plugins

This way it is immediately apparent to the committer what component
of IDA the addition is for.

### Pull requests for documentation

The `docs` branch contains the current state of documentation for this
plugin. Each module's documentation is actually generated by the
`docs/docparse.py` file based on some magic decorators that are used
to communicate semantics to the document parser.

This means other than the static documentation in `docs/static`, the
documentation for each function and its parameters will need to be
modified within the module that actually contains it.

If something on there is poorly documented or is missing for some
reason, please prefix your PR title with "docs/" and follow the same
method as described in "Titling pull requests". If you've updated the
documentation for "matching.rst", then title it like:

    docs/matching: fixed some really bad english

Or if it's some documentation in a particular module such as
`base/instruction.py` one can use:

    docs/instruction: fixed the spacing for the module autodocs

The reason being is that any modifications to the documentation's
autodocs will need to be backported into the `master` branch. This
"docs/" prefix will notify the primary committer that this needs to
happen.

## Requested work

The following pull requests are desired:

* Pull requests that introduce support for new architectures (registers
  or operands)
* Pull requests involving the decompiler (I don't really use it, thus
  I haven't found a reason to write wrappers around its functionality)
* Bug fixes (A lot of refactoring was done to get this plugin to a
  release state. Some stuff might be broken, but who knows)
* Documentation issues or especially translation to other languages
* Fixes for any of the issues that are listed in GitHub's issue tracker

## New Versions of IDA (Tags)

If a new version of IDA gets released, a new git tag will be created with
its name matching the previous version of IDA that the plugin was developed
against. This is primarily for bisecting against in case something in the
future gets broken. IDAPython's API is pretty much a moving target so
we need all the help we can get!

## Conclusion

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this plugin!
